## **Reasoning for Carrying Forward #23**

- **Issue #23: Create Listview Template, for the Accommodation Booking Page** was picked up mid-sprint. 
- While the backend for the accommodation booking system was completed and functional, the front-end for the booking page had basic wireframes and design implemented but wasn't fully polished.
- The **UI** needed further enhancements to improve user experience, such as better styling, design integration, and interactive components. This is planned for the **next sprint**, where additional work will be done to make the front-end more user-friendly and visually appealing.

This concludes **Sprint 1** for **Roam.io**. The team has made significant progress on the core features, and we're looking forward to continuing the development in the next sprint.
